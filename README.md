# Word Search Solver

This is just a project that I did for a coding class. It solves word searches that you paste into the terminal. It works well for word searches that you can copy and paste from the internet. The code has yet to be fully organized and documented. I may increase the efficiency of the code later, but this is TBD.

## Usage
1) Open *WordSearchSolver.java* in an editor of your choice. I used VS Code to run this project.
2) Run the code. You will be prompted to paste a word search into the terminal. A link for some word searches is provided. You can usually copy and paste the word searches by attempting to print them, then highlighting all the leters.

3) Using the same technique, copy and paste the words from the word bank into the terminal. Typing "end!" as your last word will signal to the program that you are done enetering words.

4) When you are done, the program will return your word search with all the words highlighted, if it has found them. If the program throws a runtime error, ensure that you have pasted the word search properly into the terminal. Unusual whitespaces may affect the functionality of the program.
